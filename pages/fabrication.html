        The nose is the front end of the model rocket (astounding, I know). It
        is made of two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nose</li>
        <li>Shoulder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The shape of the nose can vary widely, leading to different aerodynamic
        profiles. Some common nose shapes are in the table below. Click on them
        to learn more about each nose type.

        The nose must always be free to slide forward and come off. Therefore,
        the back end of the nose is cut down to form an internal shoulder which
        will slide inside the body tube and hold the nose in place. The base
        diameter of the nose should match the <em>outside</em> diameter of the
        body tube, while the diameter of the shoulder should match the
        <em>inner</em> diameter of the body tube so that it will slip-fit inside
        the tube. It's better to have the shoulder a little loose because you
        can always build it up by wrapping tape around the shoulder. If it's too
        large, then you'll need to sand the shoulder down. A rule of thumb for
        testing the looseness of the shoulder is that it should pull easily from
        the body tube but shouldn't rattle if you shake the body tube.<br /><br />
        The nose must be made of plastic or balsa wood, but never metal. Nor
        should a metal pin or nail be attached to the tip as it could turn a
        malfunctioning rocket into a missile or lawn dart. Besides, rounded nose
        tips perform better than pointed ones.<br /><br />
        Several commercial noses are available, and it can be very simple to
        select a Designing one's own nose cone is a lot of fun and one of the
        key ways to customize a rocket. It is also one of the key components of
        a rocket's stability and aerodynamics. It is therefore
        <strong><em>very</em></strong> important that fabricated model matches
        the computer design.

      <h1 id="Body-Tube">Body Tube</h1>
      <p>
        Body tubes for model rockets are usually mjade from thin walled paper
        tubes. Because such tubes are not easy to make, most model rocketeers
        buy them ready-made from hobby shops or by direct mail from
        manufacturers<br /><br />The standard available body tubes are given
        below with their inner and outer diameters.

      <h2>Measuring & Marking</h2>
      <p>To cut a tube to the required length, first measure the desired length of tube with a steel rule or with one of the yellow marking guides. The yellow guides allow you to set a marker to the desired length and insert a pencil into the hole at one end. Then to mark the cutting line around the tube, simply twist the tube in place, allowing the pencil to scribe a perfectly flat line around the tube.</p>
      <img src="" id="marking-guide-01"/><img src="" id="marking-guide-02"/>
      <p>It really pays to use precision tools like this rather than eyeballing a flat line, as a messy or angled cut will prevent a nose or transition from sitting straight in the tube and could seriously impose some rotational forces on the rocket in flight.</p>
      &nbsp;
      <p>To cut the tube along the scribed line, you can use cutting guides for tubes of BT60 or smaller. Take the appropriate sized cutting guide, separate it into halves and slide the part with the flat edge up to the penciled line. Then slide the other half up until it tightens the cutting guide in place.<br><br>
      Cut the tube with an X-acto knife. Make several passes around the tube with the blade, cutting only a little on each pass. Don't try to cut all the way through the tube on the first pass or try to stab the tip of the knife through or you'll mess up the tube. With a little patience, and with some practice, you should be able to cut a body tube so that you can't tell it was cut to custom length.
